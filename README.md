# Introduction
This project is a music recommendation system that uses item similarity-based collaborative filtering to suggest songs to users.
The system leverages a dataset of user-song interactions to predict and recommend songs that a user might like based on their listening history.
# Features
Item Similarity-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends songs based on the similarity of items (songs).
User Recommendations: Generates personalized recommendations for users.
Song Metadata Integration: Integrates song metadata for enhanced recommendations.
Evaluation and Visualization: Includes tools for evaluating the accuracy of the recommendation system and visualizing data.
# Installation
o run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
